# Heart Disease Health Indicators: Strategic EDA
**Author:** Jyoti Prakash Das  
**Project Scope:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the BRFSS 2015 Health Indicators Dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes survey data from **253,680 respondents** to identify the strongest predictors of heart disease. By examining demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, we aim to uncover actionable insights that can inform preventative healthcare strategies and risk management.

### **Key Objectives:**
* Identify primary clinical red flags for cardiovascular events.
* Analyze the impact of socioeconomic status (Income/Education) on heart health.
* Address statistical anomalies like the "Alcohol Paradox" using age-adjusted analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights (Executive Summary)

![Key Findings Infographic](Professional_Risk_Infographic.png)

1. **Clinical Dominance:** High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol are the strongest binary predictors, showing a 3x higher prevalence in the positive class.
2. **The Aging Factor:** Heart disease risk increases exponentially after age 50, making age the primary non-modifiable risk driver.
3. **Socioeconomic Shield:** Higher Income and Education levels correlate with significantly lower disease rates, highlighting health inequality.
4. **General Health Perception:** Self-reported "General Health" shows a strong correlation (r=0.25) with actual cardiac events, proving patient self-awareness is a valid diagnostic tool.
